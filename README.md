This project allows a user to search for breweries within the United States 
by city, state, or brewery name.  Open Brewery DB returns the results of the 
search.  After a brewery is selected a starting point is entered and the 
bicycle directions from Google Maps API are returned. The coordinates are 
determined by the Mapquest Geocoding API.

Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
